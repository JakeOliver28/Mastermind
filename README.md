# Mastermind

## Purpose
This project simulates the game Mastermind. 

The player tries to guess the correct "code," which is a sequence of ordered letters. After each guess, the player is told how many exact guesses (correct letters in correct locations) and inexact guesses (correct letters in incorrect locations) there were. The player must correctly guess the code before the max number of guesses is reached.  

## Usage
Use command "./a.out filename1.txt filename2.txt ..." to count the words in the files.  
If no filenames are given, the program will take input from stdin until an EOF is detected.  
Add "-n[X]" as an argument to change how many words are displayed. X is the desired number of words to be displayed. 10 is the default amount.
