# Mastermind

## Purpose
This project simulates the game Mastermind. 

The player tries to guess the correct "code," which is a sequence of ordered letters. After each guess, the player is told how many exact guesses (correct letters in correct locations) and inexact guesses (correct letters in incorrect locations) there were. The player must correctly guess the code before the max number of guesses is reached.  

## Usage
Use command "./a.out" to run the program. Follow the prompts to play the game.  
Use command "./a.out -show" to show the correct code at the beginning of the game.
